## Why have i started using Markdown for notes

Markdown helps me to take **make sentences stand out**. I can style my notes with header, lists, bold, italic, links, pictures, and other elements. It is very lightweight markup language.  

## How do I use Markdown in Desktop?

Right now I am using 3 editors for taking notes, I am using all of them so that I can check which one is best for me.  

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
I use Code with some extensions like [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview), [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) and [Markdown PDF](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf). Both of these extensions are very useful and recommended by me.

2. [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
It is another free editor with lots of awesome and unique features. It may lag or hang sometimes but works fine too.  

3. [Notable](https://notable.app)
It is also free like other listed editors, it need lots of updates but it looks clean, simple, fast and does not lag/hang.  

I am going to use all these editors and I will same my experience in next blog.

Thank you for reading.
