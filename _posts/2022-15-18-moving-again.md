## My journey

> I am in my 20s, I have been moving around the country in approx. every 2nd year. When I was just 1 year old I started moving with my dad because of his regular transfers. I have traveled North, West, East and bit lower than central India. Yes I haven't visited South India yet but someday I will.

### Moving house again

> Today I am helping my mom with packing the house for 12th time. So that my mom and sis can go to our real home. haha taking about real house is kind of odd but tbh[^1] it makes me sad that my life is taking a important turn and now I will miss these days. Packing again-n-again is really hard but I like it because whenever we open these packing boxes we get a chance to view our Picture Albums and it brings back lots of beautiful memories and some sad one too. This time I have to pack my stuff separately because I am going to stay here.  
I realized how much belonging I have after packing some of my stuff. I have to pack my stuff in 3 different portion. 1st I had to pack those things I will need in daily life. 2nd Some books and extra stuff that I will need but not sure when so that I will have to drop these things to my relatives. So that I can take anything as per my need to my room. 3rd extra belonging that I don't need here. Living alone can become pain you don't keep important stuff near you.

### Pain before moving

> I use to hate moving to new place whenever I look everything getting packed but on other hand I was always happy that we will move to a new place and I will we able to explore more new places and people.  
But only think that hurts more is losing you friends and knowing that we will not be able to meet again.[^2]  

### Pain after moving

> About 6 years ago I purchased a awesome & bit expensive bicycle and after 6 months we moved to a place which was 2000 K.M away and when I got it back in 2 pieces. This is one of the many problem in shifting the house.
> When I moved out of Army area (cantt.) for first time I found myself in a place where I was having problem understanding civilian people and making new friends. After leaving my friends behind I use to miss them and our daily routine but after meeting those civilian kids I saw a big difference in there behavior and thinking.

### Happiness after moving

> After moving to a new place it takes some days to set everything in its place, finding shops, taking admission in school and after a month you forget about your last posting and just focus on moving forward. looking forward to new friends, new places to travel, looking forward to local language, and enjoying the experience of starting/learning something new.  
Every new area means new Regiments and new stories. I love listening to stories of Army persons. They are just G.O.A.T.[^3]  
Meeting these new always bring me motivation, knowledge and hope.
